### Project functionality
On the main page, the user can browse the catalog of vehicles and has the ability to view specifications and images for a specific vehicle. The main page also features a search bar that allows the user to easily find the desired vehicle. There are also displays of vehicle categories that facilitate the user in finding vehicles more easily. 

Outside of the main page, there are additional functionalities such as adding one's own vehicle to the catalog for purchase/rental, and viewing the user's own profile where they can see a list of vehicles they have added to the catalog or vehicles they have purchased/rented. After purchasing/renting a vehicle, the user can see the personal contact information of the person from whom they bought the vehicle in order to contact them for further arrangements.
